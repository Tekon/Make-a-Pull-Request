## About me:

I am currently in my final year at university studying Media Production. I chose to study it because at the time of choosing I had started learning web development and so I was torn between doing that or sticking with my long-time passion of film. 3 years later I still can't decide.
Currently I'm looking into developing a mobile game. I started off learning Swift however I moved on to learning C# inside the Unity game engine as I realised that was better suited for my mobile game idea.

## Languages:

- HTML
- CSS

Currently inexperienced in or still learning:
- JS
